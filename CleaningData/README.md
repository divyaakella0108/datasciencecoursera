This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:
1. Uploads the required Datasets : Train Data, Test Data, Feature, Activity Type
2. Merges the train & test data sets
3. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement along with other required columns
4. Writes the tidy data to an output file
